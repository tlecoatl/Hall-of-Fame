    info: 'When Zordon finds five teenagers with attitude, he gives them the power to become Power Rangers. Along with the gear and weapons, Zordon also bestows upon them the ability to call upon giant robots that can combine into one. The Megazord is a classic for a reason. The look is iconic, the colors do not feel out of place, and the Megazord was always there for the Rangers. It may not have been the strongest Megazord the Rangers used, but it helped them take out any monster Rita Repulsa threw at them and aided them in becoming household names at the franchise peak.',

    info: 'After Lord Zedd destroyed the Zords, Zordon and Alpha used the remains of the original Zords to create brand new Thunder Zords. From here on out, the Thunder Megazord became the default robot the Rangers would use to defeat whatever creature Zedd could summon. The Thunder Zord stood out from its use of mythical creatures and an impressive Samurai design for its Megazord form. None of the colors clash with each other, the lion Zord head surprisingly meshes well and does not look out of place, and the addition of a mouth gives it a human touch. It makes for a worthy successor to the original Megazord.',

Now, with his immense power, The Megazord and Dragonzord could combine with Titanus to become the all-powerful Dino Ultrazord. This Megazord is essentially a giant tank with the upper body of the Dragonzord, adding to its impressive arsenal. Titanus head and neck make a great looking cannon, while the Dragonzords attachment gives the Megazord a combat-armor look to it.',
